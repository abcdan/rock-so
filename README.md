# rock-so
🪨 An unofficial wrapper around the Rock.so public API. It's simple but it does it's thing!

## Installation
It's really simple. All you need is Node.js and NPM/Yarn installed!
```cli
npm i rock-so
```
or
```cli
yarn add rock-so
```

## Usage
It's pretty simple, just create a custom webhook in your Rock space and then create a Rock client in your code. Here's an example on how to send a message to the channel
```js
const Rock = require("rock-so");
    // Fill in the token of the client
  const client = new Rock("YOUR TOKEN HERE"); 
  const res = await client.sendMessage({
    text: "how are you", // The message you want to send
  });

  console.log(res); // Prints the ID of the message sent

```

You're done! You've sent a message. More examples are in the `/examples` directory. (Not right now, they'll be added later...)
## Docs
There's also documentation available, it's autogenerated but it should give you an idea on what it is. _If you find an issue in the comments be sure to open an issue. The docs are automatically generated with an AI so there are some issues sometimes..._

💻 You can generate 'em yourself with `npm run docs`. It'll make a `docs` folder with HTML.

## Credits
Thanks for for people at Rock.so for making the platform. I truly love it.
